    "Role intent: teach the practical setup or operation with a clean step sequence while preserving the real product. Preserve the supplied reference product as the unchanged subject; use callout arrows, labels, hands, line, water, or small step panels around it, but do not redesign the lure body, paint pattern, segments, tail, hooks, lip, blade, or hardware. For fishing lures or bait, keep belly and tail treble hooks hanging from their original underside and tail hangers; never relocate hooks or hangers onto the top, back, side, fish mouth, or hand; attach the fishing line through the exact visible line-tie, tow eye, or split ring already present on the reference lure, using the same physical attachment point consistently in the main image and step panels; if the reference lure uses a front/nose tow eye ahead of the diving lip, use that front/nose tow eye; do not assume or add a top/back ring unless it is already visible in the reference; do not tie the line to the body, eye, hook hanger, belly, tail, mouth, propeller, diving lip, blade, or an invented ring, and do not add a hook, loose connector, or extra ring at the lure mouth or back.",
